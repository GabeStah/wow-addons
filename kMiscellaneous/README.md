kMiscellaneous
==============
kMiscellaneous is a World of Warcraft interface addon created by Kulldar of US-Hyjal and overall isn't meant to serve many purposes. :)  It exists for a personal tool to solve a few *very specific* problems that I couldn't easily solve with other addons.  The feature list for this addon will expand over time, but you're likely only going to use this if you need access to one of the very specific features found below.

FEATURES
* Grid addon dynamic configuration settings (automatically update your Grid position & size based on the group/raid size you are in).
* Copy Grid layout settings from an existing Grid configuration.
* Grid settings can be saved into any one of a variety of group/raid-sized profiles (solo, 5-man, 10-man, and 25-man).
* Automatically enable/disable the Mature Language Filter setting (useful when other Battle.net games toggling this).
